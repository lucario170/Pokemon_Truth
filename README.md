About the project :
This is parody game project of the original pokemon console games like Fire Red, Gold and silver versions. This is not a ROM hack, it is a PC game.

Purpose of this repository :
A public repository is for downloading the public build of the game. Also other public assets and their source are available.

Status of the project :
 Currently SUSPENDED.
 Yes, suspended. I'm planning to port the project to a much flexible development platform. (Unity or Unreal). However this repository will   host link to the current playable demo which briefly explains the plot and my plans for the game mechanics.
